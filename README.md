A fun little project I worked on to refresh my basic Physics knowledge. Using the olcPixelEngine the program calculates and simulates trajectories and orbits of massive bodies. The bodies can interact with each other if given sufficient mass or can interact with multiple static bodies.
A big thanks to javid for the olcPixelEngine!
